      </center>
    </header>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      TypeScript is similar to JavaScript in that they have the same features, 
      but TypeScript then adds its own type system on top.<br> JavaScript does not check for 
      inconsistencies within assigned primitives, however TypeScript does.<br>
    Hopefully by the end of this brief overview you will gain at least a working knowledge 
      of TypeScript and be able to start using it effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Defining Types</h2>
      <p>
        Consider the following block of code:<br><br>
        <img src="./images/image1.png"> <br><br>

        Using the syntax “user: User”, you declare that this JavaScript object conforms to the shape 
        of the new interface.<br>
        By putting the name in quotations (“Hayes”) you are assigning it as a string.<br>
        The id is assumed to be a number since no quotations are used. (600 != “600”).<br><br>

        When you are inconsistent, or just have an object that doesn’t match your provided interface, 
        <br>you will get a warning that looks like this:<br><br>
        <img src="./images/image2.png"> <br><br>

        TypeScript, like JavaScript, supports classes and OOP. You can use an interface declaration with 
        classes like the below code block:<br><br>
        <img src="./images/image3.png"><br><br>

        Interfaces can also be used to annotate parameters and return values:<br><br>
        <img src="./images/image4.png"> <br><br>

        TypeScript, as mentioned before, has all the features of JavaScript and then some. 
        This extends to primitive types as well.<br> Every Type Script has all of the primitive 
        types that are used within JavaScript then adds more.
        This includes ‘any’(allows anything), <br>‘unknown’(ensure someone using this type 
        declares what the type is), ‘never’(it’s not possible that this type could happen), 
        and<br> ‘void’(a function which returns undefined or has no return value).
      </p>


    <h2>Types by Inference</h2>
    <p>
      Inference “knows” the type of the variable being created. See the line of code:<br><br>
      <img src="./images/image5.png"><br><br>
      This is Types by Inference, TypeScript is inferring what is trying to be done. 
      The ‘let’ keyword is used to declare a local variable,<br> then the name of the variable 
      (helloWorld), and since “Hello World” is in quotations, TypeScript labels it as a string. 
      As stated before, <br>inference means that 600 and “600” are seen as different variables and 
      different variable types.<br><br>
            let value = “600”<br>
	          return value + 2<br><br>

            let value = 600<br>
	          return value + 2<br><br>
            The first code block will, because of inference, return 6002. 
            Whereas the bottom would return 602.
    </p>

    <h2>Composing Types</h2>
    <p>
      TypeScript allows you to use <strong>unions</strong> or <strong>generics</strong> to combine simple types into more complex types.
    </p>
    <h3>Unions</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="./images/image6.png"><br><br>
      Here we see that a boolean is created without the term “boolean”. Just by using ‘ | ‘ in the
	    “true | false;” is enough.<br> This type of union is commonly used to describe a set of string
	    or number literals a value can be, for example:<br><br>
      <img src="./images/image7.png"><br><br>
      This can also be used for handling different types:<br><br>
      <img src="./images/image8.png"><br><br>
      Below is a table that shows the keyword “typeof”:<br><br>
      <img src="./images/image9.png"><br><br>
      This can be very useful when dealing with different variable types within a single
	    function.<br><br>
      <img src="./images/image10.png"><br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>Generics</h3>
    <p>
      An array without generics could contain anything, whereas an array with generics can
	    describe the values that the array contains.<br><br>
