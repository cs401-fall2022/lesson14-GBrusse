<h1>Brief explanation of TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers</h1>
<p>
  TypeScript is similar to JavaScript in that they have the same features, 
  but TypeScript then adds its own type system on top. JavaScript does not check for 
  inconsistencies within assigned primitives, however TypeScript does.
Hopefully by the end of this brief overview you will gain at least a working knowledge 
  of TypeScript and be able to start using it effectively.
